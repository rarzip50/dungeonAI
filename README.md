# Dungeon

This is a basic demo of a random dungeon generator written in JavaScript leveraging the HTML5 canvas tag for rendering. It has some very basic input handling for moving around in the dungeon and allows for infinite exploration as each floor leads down to a new one once the stairs are found.
